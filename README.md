# SafeBite: Blockchain-Based Food Traceability System

## Overview

SafeBite is an enterprise-grade blockchain solution for food supply chain traceability. The system provides end-to-end product tracking from production to consumption, ensuring transparency, authenticity, and regulatory compliance through immutable blockchain records.

## Key Features

- **Role-Based Access Control**: Five distinct roles (Producer, Distributor, Retailer, Regulator, Consumer) with granular permissions
- **Product Lifecycle Management**: Complete tracking from registration through delivery
- **Immutable Provenance Records**: All product events permanently stored on blockchain
- **Quality & Compliance Verification**: Automated certificate generation and authenticity verification
- **QR Code Integration**: Product identification and consumer verification via QR scanning
- **Real-Time Status Tracking**: Product status updates throughout the supply chain

## System Architecture

The system is built on a four-tier architecture:

### 1. Smart Contracts Layer
Solidity smart contracts deployed on Ethereum-compatible blockchain:
- **SafeBiteAccessRoles.sol**: Role-based access control and permission management
- **SafeBiteSupplyChain.sol**: Core business logic for product lifecycle, transfers, and verification

### 2. Backend API Layer
Express.js REST API server providing:
- Smart contract interaction abstraction
- Business logic implementation
- QR code generation services
- Data formatting and validation

### 3. Frontend Application Layer
React.js web application featuring:
- Role-based dashboards
- MetaMask wallet integration
- QR code scanning and generation
- Real-time product verification

### 4. Blockchain Network Layer
Ethereum-compatible network (Hardhat for local development, configurable for testnets/mainnet)

- **Permissions**: Receive products, update shipment status, transfer to retailers/consumers
- **Use Cases**: Logistics companies, wholesale distributors

### RETAILER
- **Responsibilities**: Inventory management, quality assessments, consumer sales
- **Permissions**: Receive products, perform quality checks, transfer to consumers
- **Use Cases**: Grocery stores, retail chains, markets

### REGULATOR
- **Responsibilities**: Compliance auditing, quality verification, system oversight
- **Permissions**: View all products, perform compliance checks, perform quality checks
- **Use Cases**: Government agencies, food safety inspectors, certification bodies

### CONSUMER
- **Responsibilities**: Product verification, provenance review
- **Permissions**: Verify authenticity, view complete product history, scan QR codes
- **Use Cases**: End consumers, verification services

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** v16 or higher
- **npm** v7 or higher (or yarn)
- **MetaMask** browser extension (for frontend interaction)
- **Git** (for version control)

## Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jalpatel11/SafeBite-Blockchain-Food-Traceability.git
cd SafeBite-Blockchain-Food-Traceability
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install root dependencies (Hardhat, deployment tools)
npm install

# Install backend dependencies
cd backend
npm install

# Install frontend dependencies
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

### 3. Start Local Blockchain

```bash
# From project root
npm run node
```

This starts a local Hardhat network on `http://127.0.0.1:8545` with Chain ID 1337.

### 4. Deploy Smart Contracts

In a new terminal:

```bash
npm run deploy:local
```

Contract addresses are saved to `deployments/local.json`.

### 5. Configure Backend

```bash
cd backend
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with contract addresses from `deployments/local.json`:

```env
RPC_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8545
ACCESS_CONTROL_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=<from deployments/local.json>
SUPPLY_CHAIN_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=<from deployments/local.json>
PORT=3000
```

Start backend server:

```bash
npm start
```

### 6. Configure Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env`:

```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3000
VITE_ACCESS_CONTROL_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=<from deployments/local.json>
VITE_SUPPLY_CHAIN_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=<from deployments/local.json>
VITE_RPC_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8545
VITE_CHAIN_ID=1337
```

Start frontend development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 7. Assign Roles

In a new terminal:

```bash
./assign-roles.sh
```

This assigns roles to the default Hardhat test accounts.

### 8. Configure MetaMask

1. Install MetaMask browser extension
2. Add custom network:
   - Network Name: Hardhat Local
   - RPC URL: `http://127.0.0.1:8545`
   - Chain ID: `1337`
   - Currency Symbol: ETH
3. Import test accounts from `ACCOUNTS_REFERENCE.md`
4. Connect wallet to the application

Producers register products with metadata including name, batch ID, origin, and optional metadata hash. Each product receives a unique identifier.

### Ownership Transfers
Products can be transferred between stakeholders with automatic status updates and transfer history recording.

### Verification System
- **Quality Checks**: Retailers and regulators perform quality assessments
- **Compliance Checks**: Regulators verify regulatory compliance
- **Authenticity Verification**: Automatic verification when quality and compliance checks pass

### Provenance Tracking
Complete immutable history of:
- Product registration events
- Ownership transfers
- Status updates
- Verification records

## API Documentation

See `backend/README.md` for complete API endpoint documentation.

## Development

### Running Tests

```bash
# Backend tests
cd backend
npm test

# Contract tests (if implemented)
npm run test
```

### Building for Production

```bash
# Frontend production build
cd frontend
npm run build
```

### Environment Variables

See `.env.example` files in `backend/` and `frontend/` directories for required configuration.

## Troubleshooting

### Backend Connection Issues
- Verify Hardhat node is running: `npm run node`
- Check RPC_URL in backend `.env`
- Ensure contracts are deployed: `npm run deploy:local`

### Frontend Connection Issues
- Verify backend is running on port 3000
- Check `VITE_API_URL` in frontend `.env`
- Ensure MetaMask is connected to Hardhat Local network

### Role Assignment Issues
- Run `./assign-roles.sh` after deploying contracts
- Verify backend is running before assigning roles
- Check contract addresses match deployment

### MetaMask Issues
- Ensure Hardhat Local network is added (Chain ID: 1337)
- Verify test accounts are imported
- Check network connection in MetaMask

## Security Considerations

- Private keys should never be committed to version control
- Development endpoints (`/api/roles/grant-dev`) are for local testing only
- Production deployments require proper authentication and authorization
- Smart contracts should be audited before mainnet deployment
